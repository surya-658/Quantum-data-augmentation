# Quantum-data-augmentation

Quantum data augmentation is a quantum model that is used to enhance the data 

This quantum model using quantum functions  like superposition and entanglement and quantum gates like hadamard and controlled not enhance the existing data 

The data will be enhnaced thus new rich features will be seen in the data 

This enhanced data will then be used to train the ML models

This enhanced data when used will give  advantage in terms of accuracy thus helps us in training the model better.

MNIST data set is used and the ML model used is SVM with linear kernel

With the normal data the accuracy attained was 60 % and with the quantum augmented data the accuracy attained was 74%

Thus with the augmented data the model was able to gain more accuracy
